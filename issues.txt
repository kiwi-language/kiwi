Issues of the mapping module:

1 Not supporting generic source type or generic target type

2 When visiting entity graph in DefContext.flush, instances in the graph are ignored. I works correctly right now because
instances in the graph are either NullInstance or enum constants which are processed separately. However, other kinds of
instances will not be persisted if they appear in the future such as Field.defaultValue.
